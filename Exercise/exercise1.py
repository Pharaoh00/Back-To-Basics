# Exercise from Control Flow
# Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
# But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz".
# For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

# RULES:
# Don't search the anwser on google.
# If you need any help you can ask me.
# Don't be angry if you can't find the solution,
# because this problem is quite simple but people
# who has enough experiences can't do this.
# BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW THE BASICS!
# It's so simple as priting something on the console with python.

# Tip:
# For check if a number is a multiple of something you need to use the
# modulus from math. This mean the factorization.
# This this example:
# print(5 % 5) # output: 0
# print(15 % 5) # output: 0
# print(26 % 3) # output: 2
# print(6 % 3) # output: 0
# So for you know if a number is a multiple of something
# you need to test them and if is 0 the number is a multiple.
#
# GOOD LUCK
